## About Me

Hi, here is **Congda Ma**. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at [School of Engineering
Department of Information and Communications Engineering](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/ict/),  [Institute of Science Tokyo(formerly Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/)

My supervisor is [Prof. Manabu Okumura](http://www.lr.pi.titech.ac.jp/~oku/index-e.html) at [Okumura-Funakoshi Lab](https://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/wp/). 

I am working in Natural Language Processing.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing. 
I am passionate about addressing common issues in Generative AI, such as biases and hallucinations, present in pre-trained language models. 
I also have a strong interest in multimodal models and am currently engaged in related projects. 
I am dedicated to contributing to the development of models that generate reliable and trustworthy outputs.
